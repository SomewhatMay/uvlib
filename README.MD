uvlib is an open-source PROS library that brings the Command-Based Programming paradigm in an intuitive and creative way.
* **Declarative**: You're more than just a programmer; you're a designer and an engineer. Just explain what you want done, let uvlib worry about the how.
* **Command-Based**: Rediscover the DRY principle‚Äîthe oldest, and perhaps most important, programming concept‚Äîall over again in PROS. Keep your code clean, organized, and reusable across multiple seasons.
* **Extensible**: Built to grow with your projects. Easily integrate new features, customize behaviors, and adapt uvlib to your evolving needs.

## üî• Inspiration
Much of this project was inspired by [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html), the library trusted by the FIRST Robotics Competition. Many of the design decisions were made to align with WPILib's Command-Based Programming structure. You can learn more about the paradigm [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html).
