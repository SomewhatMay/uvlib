uvlib is an open-source PROS library that brings the Command-Based Programming paradigm to V5 Robotics in an creative and intuitive way.
* **Declarative**: You're more than just a programmer; you're a designer and an engineer. Just explain what you want done, let uvlib worry about the how.
* **Command-Based**: Rediscover the DRY principle‚Äîthe oldest, and perhaps most important, programming concept‚Äîall over again in PROS. Keep your code clean, organized, and reusable across multiple seasons.
* **Extensible**: Built to grow with your projects. Easily integrate new features, customize behaviors, and adapt uvlib to your evolving needs.

## üî• Inspiration
Much of this project was inspired by [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) and its Command-Based Programming structure. WPILib is the library trusted by hundreds of FIRST Robotics teams worldwide. Many of the design decisions were made to align with WPILib's implementation. You can learn more about the paradigm [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html).
